        <h1>Common Myths about Autism</h1>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autism is caused by vaccines</h2>
                <p>The biggest myth of all is that vaccines, specifically the MMR vaccine, cause autism. The safety of vaccinations has been repeatedly tested across large groups of people. High quality research studies involving hundreds of thousands of people have consistently shown that vaccinations do not cause autism.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autism is a childhood condition</h2>
                <p>Autism is lifelong. In fact in the UK there are more autistic adults than children. Autistic adults have been overlooked in research, though, so we're supporting a number of studies to find the best ways to support them at every stage of their life. Research suggests that outcomes can change for people over time if they get the right support, for example with language and communication and anxiety.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autistic people have a special talent</h2>
                <p>We know a lot of parents and autistic adults get asked about this, and it can be frustrating. We all have strengths and weaknesses and autistic people are no different. Being autistic doesn't necessarily make you the next Einstein.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autistic people have learning disabilities</h2>
                <p>With the right support and a suitable environment, many autistic people are able and independent. Around 1 in 4 autistic people speak few or no words, but they can find other ways to communicate. Some autistic people take longer to process information, but it doesn’t mean they don't understand. Many autistic people also have excellent strengths that they attribute to being autistic. These include strong attention to detail, creative thinking and excellent pattern recognition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autistic people are anti-social</h2>
                <p>Autistic people may need support with social skills or interact differently with the world around them, but most autistic people enjoy having relationships. People show their social difficulties in different ways. Some are quiet and shy or avoid social situations, others speak too much and struggle to have two-way conversations. Unspoken communication can confuse autistic people; they might find body language, tone of voice and sarcasm difficult to read. These challenges can make it difficult to make friends, build relationships or get on at work. Taking time to get to know autistic people and understand their differences in an environment where they are happy makes all the difference.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autism can be cured</h2>
                <p>Whilst autism is different for everyone, the majority of autistic adults and families that we speak to feel that autism is a big part of their life, and not something that they would take away. Our research aims to give autistic people the support and services they need to live a happy, healthy and long life. Autism is a complex condition that affects everyone differently, so we focus our efforts on the questions that autistic people tell us they want answered.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Only boys are autistic</h2>
                <p>More males have an autism diagnosis than females. However, people of any gender can be autistic. Girls are more likely to 'mask' their autism, learning the skills to interact with non-autistic people better than boys. This can mean that many autistic girls get a diagnosis much later in life than boys.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-12">
                <h2>Autism is caused by bad parenting</h2>
                <p>Autism is not caused by bad parenting. Research has proved that parenting is not to blame. We are funding studies at the moment to support parents and help them better understand autism. This approach can improve an autistic child’s communication skills. Parenting style can certainly help an autistic child cope with the world, but it is definitely not the root cause of autistic behaviour.</p>
